# Coffee and Code 01

## Things you'll wanna have ready so y'all can just jump into it:

- Spin off a new git repo. Call it whatever you want, maybe coffee-and-code-01 or somesuch (in case there's more of these)
- It'll be in React, purely frontend oriented; no styling (or SCSS lib) will be necessary
  - This task doesn't really REQUIRE React as it is scoped, but I eventually wanna have y'all build off of this
  - or at the very least, re-implement it in another framework like Vue, Vite, or Svelte... but NOT for this iteration
- You will be integrating an existing API and rendering the data you get back from it
- You will need to register and get an API key. I'll let you know what it is when we kick it off tomorrow.
